## Introduction

This document presents a typeface that reproduces the appearance of the Roman cursive in its ancient version. It is modeled on the letters read on wooden tablets found during excavations in Vindolanda

> The anaerobic conditions at the Roman fort of Vindolanda, close to Hadrian's Wall in northern Britain, have famously preserved a variety of finds made of organic materials, including wooden writing tablets and a pair of leather boxing gloves. 
[@doi:10.15184/aqy.2023.11]

The most famous is [tablet 291](https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/TabVindol291) with a birthday invitation from Claudia Severa. Her letters are mainly used as a model for the font.

> The elegant script in which this letter is written is also probably to be recognised in 243, 244 and 248. The letters are slim, with marked ascenders and descenders, and very little use of ligature. [@{https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/TabVindol291}]

The goal of the font is to combine the specificity of lettering in handwritten documents with the beauty of regularity in the typographic era. In this sense, the task of creating a font is similar to the one pursued in the creation of the antiqua. In the era of creating typefaces for early book printing, typographers also focused on how letters were handwritten, but the letters were uniform and didn't look too varied. 

Vindolanda font is a modern sans-serif font that is designed in a unified style. Its character is determined by the antiquity and manuscript character of the prototype @fig:letter-forms, and at the same time by the opposite trend: the modern appearance of mass-produced fonts.

B. Voronetsky and E. Kuznetsov say on ancient Greek writings:

> It is unusually simple, built sparingly clear lines of uniform thickness. [@voronetsky-kuznetsov]

I'm aiming for the same stylistic guidelines when I'm working on the Vindolanda font.

They also write about the Latin font: 

> Roman font was not something uniform and constant: it was noticeably modified and existed in various forms. 
> Its basic and original form is the capital font (lat. *caitalis* -- large, main, solid), also called majusculus (lat. *majusculis* -- somewhat larger), because it consists exclusively of capital (large) letters. An inscription made by majusculus is placed strictly between two horizontals, without a single line going beyond the line formed by them. 
> Majuscule is, first of all, the font of solemn writings carved on columns, triumphal arches and walls. (...) Its technology (...) is careful slow carving in a stone slab along a predetermined contour. (...) He is clear, harmonious and stately. (...) Another variant of the handwritten Latin writing was cursive (lat. currêre -- to run; running, means slanted). In cursive, letters were simplified, joined together, and lost some details. Quickness was achieved at the cost of loss: clarity, clarity, beauty suffered. Therefore, italics (in its various forms) was used only for business records and letters.

Vindolanda returns clarity and precision of Greek writings to Roman cursive.

Thus, it is not necessary to appeal to modernity to justify the need for this typeface.

In addition to the letters of the Latin alphabet, the font contains the letters of the Cyrillic alphabet and the extended Cyrillic alphabet for minor languages such as Bashkir, Tatar and Udmurt. These letters were created for entertainment purposes and have no historical basis. They represent only my fantasies on how the Cyrillic alphabet based on Roman cursive could have been look like. Nevertheless, the Cyrillic letters are based on the Latin letters in one way or another. How they were designed is explained in a special section in this document. 

This fancy Cyrillic was created out of a desire to make the typeface more usable and out of a desire to popularize the Roman cursive lettering.

The font can be used for more authentic reproduction in books and on websites of texts written in Roman cursive, as well as for educational purposes to practice reading texts written in Roman cursive. The font can also serve as a secret spelling for kids who want to start their own private club, like in the "Dead Poets Society" movie.


## The shape of the letters

### Overview

Traditionally, letters are drawn on the background of a grid of 16 squares proposed by A. Dürer to show their correct proportions @fig:grid. But the very nature of cursive contradicts this idea.


![
**Letter F in Vindolanda.**.
](./images/grid.png){#fig:grid}

Vindolanda is a disproportionate, fractured typeface in which the free spirit of hand-drawn letters is slightly reduced to the order we know from book printing. And it is in these fractured lines that the archaic beauty of this typeface lies. The result is something between ancient runes and the constructed writings of space civilizations in sci-fi movies @fig:overview.

### Letters

Let's compare original letters from Vindolanda and letters from Vindolanda fontface, starting with the letter A @fig:a.

![
**Letter A from tablet and from the fontface.**
](./images/a.png){#fig:a}

One of the most unlike letters we're used to @fig:b.

![
**Letter B from tablet and from the fontface.** Very vertical with a stand-alone element.
](./images/b.png){#fig:b}

It was very important to keep the angle of the stem @fig:c. 

![
**Letter C from tablet and from the fontface.**
](./images/c.png){#fig:c}

The letter d had to be modified a bit to keep the overall character and uniformity of the font, it became more like a and b @fig:d. 

![
**Letter D from tablet and from the fontface.**
](./images/d.png){#fig:d}

## Examples

Let's try to write an original birthday invitation from Vindolanda's tablet @fig:severa. See original [here](https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/TabVindol291).

**Birthday Invitation of Sulpicia Lepidina.**

It was very important to keep the angle of the stem.
